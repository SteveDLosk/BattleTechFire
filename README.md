Android App for BattleTech AlphaStrike

This is an app I am building as I learn Android Studio.  I am designing a simple app that I can
practice adding activites, features, views, and Java code-behind.  I envision the following features:

- A simple 2d6 dice roll to resolve attacks
- A probabilities page with likelyhood of success at various ranges and in cover/in open
